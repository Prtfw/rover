Hi there! Welcome to Rover!

To get started:

Clone or download the repo, navigate to the folder. Or click on this link: https://prtfw.github.io/rover/ .

1) Open the hello-rover.html file (in chrome), for optimal experience, we recommend going full screen on a 13inch+ screen

2) Enter a command sequence:
        
        - the Rover starts facings South at coordinate "[0, 0]" (with North = y-positive direction, East being x-positive direction)
        
        - a valid command sequence must consists of only "L","R","M"s; the [Go!] button will only work if the command is valid
        
        - M = move forward 1 unit, L = turn left, R = turn right
        
        - L to turn left, R to turn right and M to move one unit in the direction the rover is currently facing
        
        - i.e. MMMR will get the rover to [0,-3] facing East
    
3) The rover will report position after each command squence, the map will update to show where the rover has been

4) You can click the [undo] button to rollback your action(s) or hit the [reset] button to start from the begining [0,0] facing South

Happy Exploring!
